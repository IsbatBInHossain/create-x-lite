# create-x-lite

A modern, interactive CLI for scaffolding production-ready Express.js projects in seconds. Inspired by the developer experience of `create-vite`.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Setup:** A guided CLI that helps you configure your project exactly the way you want.
- **Language Choice:** Supports both TypeScript and JavaScript.
- **Module System Choice:** Supports both modern ESM and legacy CommonJS module systems.
- **Flexible Folder Structures:** Choose between a feature-based or traditional MVC-style structure.
- **Out-of-the-Box Tooling:** Comes with ESLint, Prettier, and Nodemon pre-configured.

## üöÄ Quick Start

To scaffold a new Express app, run:

```bash
npx create-x-lite
```

The CLI will guide you through the rest of the options!

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Roadmap

This project was built for the Boot.dev Hackathon (July 2025). The vision is to evolve this into a comprehensive backend toolkit. Future plans include:

- A powerful plugin system (for databases, auth, etc.).
- Support for additional frameworks (e.g., Koa, Fastify).
- Automatic resource generators.
